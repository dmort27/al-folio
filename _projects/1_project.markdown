Contrastive units of speech, phonemes, have different contextual realizations called allophones. For example, the English phoneme /p/ has the allophones [p] as in _spit_ and [pʰ] as in _pit_. The relationship between allophone and phone is language specific. For example, in Mandarin Chinese, the phoneme /p/ includes only [p] but in American English, /p/ includes [p] and [pʰ]. [AlloVera](http://github.com/dmort27/allovera) is a resource that provides phoneme to allophone mappings for multiple languages. This database serves as one of the basis of the Allosaurus phone recognition system, a universal speech recognizer that can phonetically transcribe speech with no in-language training data.
