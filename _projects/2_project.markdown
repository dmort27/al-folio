East Tusom is a Tangkhulic (Tibeto-Burman) language of Manipur State, India. It is highly endangered and is spoken primarily in one village in Ukhrul distinct. It has areally unsual phonetics and phonology. Our group is currently working to document East Tusom and to build speech resources based upon field recordings of the language.

A speech dataset from Tusom (called [Tusom2021](https://www.github.com/dmort27/tusom2021)) is available on GitHub. A [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00824) of the paper describing this dataset is available on arXiv. The BibTeX reference for the preprint is this:

The [manuscript]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/mortensen2021east.pdf) of our sketch of the phonetics and phonology of Tusom was just accepted by Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman area. It should appear in October.
