Starting the late 18th century, linguists developed a method for reconstructing the phonological forms of words in unattested ancestor languages (proto-languages) of a group of daughter languages. Various attempts have been made to implement the comparative method using computation models. However, these efforts have typically not been both fully unsupervised (with no phylogetic or proto-form information).
