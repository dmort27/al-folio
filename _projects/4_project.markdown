[Epitran](https://github.com/dmort27/epitran) is a multilingual grapheme-to-phoneme system with support for many languages. It converts orthographic strings (strings written in the conventional writing system) into IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) strings. It has been used by many teams for many purposes and is in continuous development. Want support for your favorite language? Let me know!
