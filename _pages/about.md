I am a computational linguist interested in phonology, morphology, language change, linguistic typology, and human-in-the-loop computation. I am currently a Systems Scientist (a non-tenure track research faculty member at the Assistant Professor level) in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/), which is part of [Carnegie Mellon University's](https://www.cmu.edu) [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). Before coming to CMU, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Pittsburgh.

I did my graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, where I recieved a PhD in Linguistics for a thesis on theoretical phonology. At the same time, I was working on various computational projects relating to language documentation and comparative reconstruction. My current position allows me to bring my various interests together. My research has two strands: uncovering how linguistic knowledge (especially of phonology and morphology) can contribute to natural language processing and using computational models to uncover linguistic knowledge and investigate linguistic hypotheses.

Along with [Lori Levin](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lsl/), I lead [LLab](https://llab-cmu.github.io/), the LTI linguistics lab.
