### Current teaching

##### Human Language for Artificial Intelligence

I'm excited about the course Human Language for Artificial Intelligence, which I teach with Lori Levin. It is an introduction to linguistics and the other language sciences (with the lamentable exception of psycholinguistics) geared towards students in computer science (especially artificial intelligence fields). We believe that this is the only course of its kind. If you are interested in our lecture notes (draft) for this course, please let me know.

##### Natural Language Processing

I co-teach an introductory [course in NLP](http://demo.clab.cs.cmu.edu/NLP/), with both undergraduate and graduate sections. I cover the linguistically oriented topics (morphology, phrase-structure syntax, dependency syntax, lexical semantics, propositional semantics, semantic role labeling, discourse, and pragmatics) We are always developing new teaching materials and new exercises. If you would like us to share, please let me know!

### Past teaching

In my past life, I taught numerous linguistics courses at both a graduate and undergraduate level:
* Field Methods
* Phonetics and Phonemics
* Phonology
* Topics in Phonological Theory
* Morphology
* Advanced Morphology
* Languages of the World
* Grammars and Lexicons

Ironically, since recieving my PhD, I have never taught Historical Linguistics, even though much of my research has been in that area.

### Future teaching

In Spring 2023, I will teach a new course, _Subword Modeling_, which will focus on modeling morphology, orthography, phonology, and (to a small degree) phonetics computationally. The course will be based around four miniprojects (two on morphology, one on orthography, and one of phonology), one of which will be developed into a term project. The course is still in development, but I'm making the [proposed syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/subword-syllabus-proposal.pdf) available to students and colleagues. If you have any questions or comments, please reach out.

In Spring 2024, I hope to teach a new course called _Computational Perspectives on Language Variation and Change_ wherein students will learn to use computational models to understand how language varies in (social and physical) space and time. The proposal for this course is currently under development.
