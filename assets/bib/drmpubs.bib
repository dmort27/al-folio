This task requires us to produce the lemma and morpho-syntactic description of each token in a sequence, for 107 treebanks. We approach this task with a hierarchical neural conditional random field (CRF) model which predicts each coarse-grained feature (eg. POS, Case, etc.) independently. However, most treebanks are under-resourced, thus making it challenging to train deep neural models for them. Hence, we propose a multi-lingual transfer training regime where we transfer from multiple related languages that share similar typology.",

                  generalization to new, less-resourced languages
                  challenging. We present two approaches for improving
                  generalization to low-resourced languages by
                  adapting continuous word representations using
                  linguistically motivated subword units: phonemes,
                  morphemes and graphemes. Our method requires neither
                  parallel corpora nor bilingual dictionaries and
                  provides a significant gain in performance over
                  previous methods relying on these resources. We
                  demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on
                  Named Entity Recognition for four languages, namely
                  Uyghur, Turkish, Bengali and Hindi, of which Uyghur
                  and Bengali are low resource languages, and also
                  perform experiments on Machine
                  Translation. Exploiting subwords with transfer
                  learning gives us a boost of +15.2 NER F1 for Uyghur
                  and +9.7 F1 for Bengali. We also show improvements
